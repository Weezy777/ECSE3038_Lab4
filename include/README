In this assignment,an ESP32 board was used to control the state of three LEDs by making a GET request to a server and using the response to set the LED states.

The state of each of the three LEDs can be changed by using this [tester site](https://ecse-three-led.netlify.app/). The site determines the behaviour of the circuit by toggling each of the three light switches. 

The relevant libraries to connect to the API and send a GET request to the `/api/state` route was used. 

The JSON response Parsed to extract the LED states, and use the `digitalWrite()` function to set the LED states in the circuit.
